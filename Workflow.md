# Workflow for portfolio
-------------
- Use github first to connect local repo to github repo.

- Use **trello**, to make a work plan.
 -[trello](https://trello.com/b/MZ4zCbBK/t1a1-portfolio-project-management).

- Use **Balsamiq Wireframes** to make a website draft.

- Start create HTML file.

- Start create Sass file and then use Sass command to turn it to CSS file.

- **Important**, need create the skeleton by myself first and then use bootstrap to update, cannot use bootstrap directly!
